# The AI Handbook

The open-source blueprint for AI Engineering. A free, illustrated curriculum taking you from ML fundamentals to production AI systems.

**Live at:** [ai.arkr.ca](https://ai.arkr.ca)

## What is this?

A structured curriculum for becoming an AI engineer. Clear explanations, visual diagrams, and practical knowledge — from ML foundations through LLMs, RAG architectures, and AI agents. No fluff. No scattered tutorials. Just a unified path to mastery.

## Curriculum

| Part | Topic | Articles |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | **Foundations** | Python, Git, Docker, SQL, APIs, System Design |
| 2 | **AI/ML Fundamentals** | Statistics, Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, Neural Networks |
| 3 | **LLMs & Generative AI** | Transformers, Prompt Engineering, Context Engineering |
| 4 | **Building AI Systems** | RAG, Vector Search, Agents, Multi-Agent, MCP, Safety |
| 5 | **AI-Assisted Development** | Cursor, Claude Code, Vibe Coding, Workflows |

## Why does this exist?

Two reasons:

1. **The AI field moves fast.** Most resources are either scattered tutorials, dense academic papers, or vendor documentation. There was no single, unified path from "Zero" to "AI Engineer." So I built one.

2. **Fundamentals matter more than ever.** When everyone can prompt an LLM, the engineers who understand *how* these systems actually work will build better products. This handbook is about that deeper understanding.

I am doing this completely for free, on my own time, simply because I just like doing it.

## 100% Human Crafted

**A Note on AI:** I use AI tools during my own research, but I do not use AI to write. Every word is typed by me, and every diagram is hand-crafted by me. This is simply human knowledge, distilled for humans.

## Built with

- **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/):** where I organize my thoughts and write the articles.
- **[Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw):** for creating the visual diagrams.
- **[HUGO](https://gohugo.io/):** to support my pipeline of obsidian(markdown) to the web(HTML).
- **[Github](https://github.com/Anish-Reddy-K/the-arkr-manual.git):** where I store all my articles.

## Development

This site is built with Hugo. To run locally:

```bash
# to see drafts rendered, overrides the coming soon template
HUGO_ENV=dev hugo server

# to see coming soon template for drafts, i.e. preview real site
HUGO_ENV=prod hugo server
```

## FAQ's

<details>
<summary>Is this really free?</summary>

Yes. It is open-source and free forever. I'm building this for fun, to help and to learn.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who is this for?</summary>

Developers transitioning into AI, engineers building AI-powered products, and anyone who wants to understand how modern AI systems actually work. Whether you're shipping your first RAG app or trying to understand transformer architectures — this is for you.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who are you?</summary>

I'm an engineer and a builder. I research these topics obsessively until I understand them well enough to explain them simply. My goal isn't to lecture you, but to document the path to AI engineering mastery clearly and visually.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Where should I start?</summary>

Start with the [Foundations](https://ai.arkr.ca/python-essentials.html) if you want to brush up on prerequisites, or jump straight into [AI/ML Fundamentals](https://ai.arkr.ca/ai-vs-ml-vs-dl.html) if you're ready to dive in.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the outcome?</summary>

You'll understand how to architect, build, and deploy AI systems. From the theory behind neural networks and transformers, to the practical engineering of RAG pipelines, AI agents, and production LLM applications.
