Continuous vs. discrete signals, sampling, quantization error, why digital wins for storage.

# Heading 1: Analog vs. Digital Signals

This is a paragraph with **bold text** and *italic text*. You can also combine them: ***bold and italic***. Here's some `inline code` within a sentence.

## Heading 2: Understanding Continuous Signals

Analog signals are continuous waveforms that can take on any value within a range. They represent real-world phenomena like sound waves, temperature, and light intensity.

### Heading 3: Key Characteristics

Here are some important points:

- **Continuous values**: Analog signals can represent infinite values
- **Noise susceptibility**: Analog signals degrade with each copy
- **Real-world representation**: Directly mirror physical phenomena

#### Heading 4: Digital Signal Basics

Digital signals, on the other hand, are discrete representations:

1. **Binary representation**: Uses only 0s and 1s
2. **Sampling**: Converts continuous signals to discrete samples
3. **Quantization**: Maps samples to finite set of values
4. **Encoding**: Represents values using binary digits

##### Heading 5: Technical Details

The conversion process involves several steps:

###### Heading 6: Deep Dive

At the most granular level, we examine individual bits.

## Code Blocks

### Inline Code

Use `console.log()` to print output. The `function` keyword defines a function.

### Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting

```javascript
function analogToDigital(signal, sampleRate) {
  const samples = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < signal.length; i += sampleRate) {
    samples.push(quantize(signal[i]));
  }
  return samples;
}
```

```python
def sample_analog_signal(signal, rate):
    """Sample an analog signal at given rate."""
    samples = []
    for i in range(0, len(signal), rate):
        samples.append(quantize(signal[i]))
    return samples
```

```rust
fn analog_to_digital(signal: &[f64], sample_rate: usize) -> Vec<u8> {
    signal
        .iter()
        .step_by(sample_rate)
        .map(|&x| quantize(x))
        .collect()
}
```

```bash
# Shell command example
ffmpeg -i input.wav -ar 44100 output.wav
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM signals 
WHERE type = 'analog' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

```json
{
  "signal": {
    "type": "analog",
    "frequency": 440,
    "amplitude": 1.0,
    "sample_rate": 44100
  }
}
```

### Basic Table

| Signal Type | Values | Storage | Noise |
|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| Analog      | Infinite | Degrades | High |
| Digital     | Discrete | Perfect | Low |

### Table with Alignment

| Left Aligned | Center Aligned | Right Aligned |
|:-------------|:--------------:|--------------:|
| Left         | Center         | Right         |

### Complex Table

| Feature | Analog | Digital | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| **Precision** | Continuous | Discrete | Digital limited by bit depth |
| **Storage** | Degrades over time | Perfect copies | Digital advantage |
| **Processing** | Analog circuits | Digital processors | Digital more flexible |
| **Bandwidth** | Limited | Limited by sampling | Nyquist theorem applies |
