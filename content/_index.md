title: "The AI Engineer's Handbook"
---
The open-source blueprint for AI Engineering. A free, illustrated curriculum taking you from ML fundamentals to production AI systems.

## What is this?
A structured curriculum for becoming an AI engineer. Clear explanations, visual diagrams, and practical knowledge — from ML foundations through LLMs, RAG architectures, and AI agents. No fluff. No scattered tutorials. Just a unified path to mastery.

## Why does this exist?
Two reasons:

1. **The AI field moves fast.** Most resources are either scattered tutorials, dense academic papers, or vendor documentation. There was no single, unified path from "Zero" to "AI Engineer." So I built one.

2. **Fundamentals matter more than ever.** When everyone can prompt an LLM, the engineers who understand *how* these systems actually work will build better products. This handbook is about that deeper understanding.

I am doing this completely for free, on my own time, simply because I just like doing it.

## 100% Human Crafted
**A Note on AI:** I use AI tools during my own research, but I do not use AI to write. Every word is typed by me, and every diagram is hand-crafted by me. This is simply human knowledge, distilled for humans.

## FAQ's

<details>
<summary>Is this really free?</summary>

Yes. It is open-source and free forever. I'm building this for fun, to help and to learn.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who is this for?</summary>

Developers transitioning into AI, engineers building AI-powered products, and anyone who wants to understand how modern AI systems actually work. Whether you're shipping your first RAG app or trying to understand transformer architectures — this is for you.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who are you?</summary>

I'm an engineer and a builder. I research these topics obsessively until I understand them well enough to explain them simply. My goal isn't to lecture you, but to document the path to AI engineering mastery clearly and visually.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Where should I start?</summary>

Start with the [Foundations](/foundations.html) if you want to brush up on prerequisites, or jump straight into [AI/ML Fundamentals](/ai-vs-ml-vs-dl.html) if you're ready to dive in.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the outcome?</summary>

You'll understand how to architect, build, and deploy AI systems. From the theory behind neural networks and transformers, to the practical engineering of RAG pipelines, AI agents, and production LLM applications.
