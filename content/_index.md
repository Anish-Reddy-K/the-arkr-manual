# The ARKR Manual

The open-source blueprint for Computer Science. A free, illustrated curriculum taking you from raw binary to complex system architecture.

## What is this?

It's a library of articles and a free education project where I deconstruct computer science and systems concepts from scratch. No fluff. Just clear analogies, hand-crafted diagrams, and the raw code that runs the world.

## Why does this exist?

Two reasons:

1. **The internet is overwhelming**. If you want to learn CS today, you have to choose between expensive, dry textbooks or fragmented 10-minute tutorials. There was no single, unified path from "Zero" to "System Architect." So I built one.

2. **Back to basics.** In the age of AI, it's easy to generate code we don't understand. I built this to prove that understanding the fundamentals, the actual code and logic, matters more now than ever. Even in the age of AI. Especially in the age of AI.

I am doing this completely for free, on my own time, simply because I love doing it.

## 100% Human Crafted

**A Note on AI:** I use AI tools to break down complex topics, but I do not use AI to write. Every word is typed by me, and every diagram is hand-crafted by me. This is simply human knowledge, distilled for humans.
