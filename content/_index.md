The open-source blueprint for Computer Science, Software Engineering, Digital Systems and System Design. A free, illustrated curriculum taking you from raw binary to complex system architecture.

## What is this?
It's a library of articles and a free education project where I deconstruct computer science and software systems concepts from scratch. No fluff. Just clear analogies, hand-crafted diagrams, and the raw code that runs the world.

## Why does this exist?
Two reasons:

1. **The internet is overwhelming**. If you want to learn CS today, you have to choose between expensive, dry textbooks or fragmented 10-minute tutorials. There was no single, unified path from "Zero" to "System Architect." So I built one.

2. **Back to basics.** In the age of AI, it's easy to generate code we don't understand. I built this to prove that understanding the fundamentals, the actual code and logic, matters more now than ever. Even in the age of AI. Especially in the age of AI.

I am doing this completely for free, on my own time, simply because I just like doing it.

## 100% Human Crafted
**A Note on AI:** I use AI tools during my own research, but I do not use AI to write. Every word is typed by me, and every diagram is hand-crafted by me. This is simply human knowledge, distilled for humans.

## FAQ's

<details>
<summary>Is this really free?</summary>

Yes. It is open-source and free forever. I'm building this for fun, to help and to learn.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who is this for?</summary>

Anyone who wants to understand how computers actually work. Whether you're a student, a self-taught dev, or a senior engineer brushing up on the basics. We start at rock bottom and go all the way up.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who are you?</summary>

I'm an engineer and a builder. I research these topics obsessively until I understand them well enough to explain them simply. My goal isn't to lecture you, but to document the path to mastery clearly and visually.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Where should I start?</summary>

[Article 1](https://manual.arkr.ca/bit.html). We start at the very basics (Bits & Information) and build our way up to the cloud (AI & Distributed Systems).
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the outcome?</summary>

You will have understood the fundamentals that make up the software we use everyday. The curriculum will end with a Case Studies chapter where we will reverse-engineer the architecture of modern giants like how **WhatsApp** handles billion-user concurrency, how **Git** actually tracks your file history, and how **Spotify** streams audio without latency and many more cases.
